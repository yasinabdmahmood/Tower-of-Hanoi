       <h1>TOWER OF HANOI</h1>
       <p>The Tower of Hanoi is a mathematical game or puzzle consisting of three rods and a 
        number of disks of various diameters, which can slide onto any rod. The puzzle begins
         with the disks stacked on one rod in order of decreasing size, the smallest at the
          top, thus approximating a conical shape. The objective of the puzzle is to move 
          the entire stack to the last rod, obeying the following rules:\
       </p>
       <ol>
        <li>
            Only one disk may be moved at a time.
        </li>
        <li>
            Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing
             it on top of another stack or on an empty rod.
        </li>
        <li>
            No disk may be placed on top of a disk that is smaller than it.
        </li>
    </ol>
